You will be given either a single Python function, a code block, or a full Python file containing multiple definitions.

Your task is to refactor the entire input while preserving its original behavior.

Your refactoring should:
- Improve readability, maintainability, and/or performance
- Respect Python idioms and best practices
- Use clear and consistent naming conventions
- Maintain existing logic and outputs unless changes clearly improve quality or clarity

Do not add explanations or comments â€” return only the fully refactored version of the input inside a ```python markdown block. Keep all functional aspects intact unless justified improvements can be made.
