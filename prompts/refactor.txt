You will be given a Python function or code block. Your task is to refactor the code while preserving its behavior.

Your refactoring should:
- Improve readability, maintainability, or performance
- Respect Python idioms and best practices
- Use appropriate naming conventions and structure
- Avoid changing external behavior or outputs unless clearly beneficial

Do not add explanations or comments â€” just return the full refactored code inside a ```python markdown block. Maintain functionality unless there's a clear and justified improvement.
