You will be given a complete Python file. Your task is to summarize its purpose and structure in a clear and concise way.

Describe:
- The overall goal or role of the file (e.g., utility module, API layer, data model)
- The key classes and functions it defines
- What each major function or class does
- Any patterns, modules, or architecture it follows (if recognizable)

Be objective and helpful â€” the summary should give a developer a quick mental model of what the code does.

Do not include the code. Return only the plain-text summary.
