You will be given a Python function. Add a docstring to it that includes:
- A brief summary of what the function does
- Descriptions of parameters
- A description of the return value (respect type hints if available)

Assume any APIs or libraries used in the function are valid and do not require explanation. Focus only on describing the outer function's purpose and behavior, not its dependencies.

Return the complete function (with the new docstring) in a ```python markdown block. Keep the original code unchanged.
